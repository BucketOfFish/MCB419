  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>In this assignment you will implement several different forms of kinesis behavior.
  <b>The goal is to understand how different behavioral stragegies influence the distribution 
    of agents in a non-uniform environment.</b>
  </p><p>
  The red/blue pattern below represents some physical parameter of the environment
    that varies across space. 
  It could represent nutrient density, light intensity, temperature, pH, etc.
  For convenience, we will refer to it as temperature, and interpret the red regions as hot and the blue regions as cold.
  The maximum temperature is 1 and the minimum temperature is 0.
  </p>
  <p> There are 100 agents in the environment. If they are randomly distributed, we expect
    the mean temperature of the population to be about 0.5, averaged across all agents.
    If the agents tend to congregate in warmer regions, then the mean temperature of the 
    population will be higher. 
  </p><p>You will implement 5 different behavioral strategies: 3 that cause agents to congregate
    in warm regions (orthokinesisNeg, klinokinesisPos, and runTumble) and 2 that
    cause agents to congregate in cold regions (orthokinesisPos, klinokinesisNeg).
  Specific instructions are provided at the bottomm of the page.

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>
  You will be editing controller code in Bot.js. A controller gets sensory input 
  from the environment and generates motor output to influence behavior. To get the
    sensed temperature, <code>tsns</code>, at the bot's current location use:<br>
  <code>let tsns = world.getTemperature(this.x, this.y);</code><br>
  To generate motor output, set the values of:<br>
  <code>this.speed</code> and <code>this.turnAngle</code>.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The wander controller has been provided for you. Run 2000 steps of the wander controller.
      What was the mean value of the temperature that you observed?<br>
      <user>The mean temp was 0.50.</user>
    </li>
    <li>In Bot.js, a simple positive-orthokinesis controller has been provided for you.
      For positive orthokinesis, the bot moves faster in warmer areas of the environment.
      In this simple implementation,the speed of the bot increases linearly with 
      temperature. 
      What was the mean temperature that you observed?<br>
      <user>The mean temp was 0.34.</user>
    </li>
    <li>Now modify the orthokinesisPos controller to make it more effective, such that
      the average temperature of the population is <u>less than 0.25</u> after 2000 steps.
      Implement a strategy where the speed is 0 when the temperature is below some
      threshold value and is 1 when the temperature is above that value. 
      What threshold value did you use, and what was the average temperature?<br>
      <user>With a threshold of 0.15, I get an average temperature of 0.13.</user>
    </li>
    <li>A simple negative-orthokinesis controller has been provided for you.
      For negative orthokinesis, the bot moves slower in warmer areas of the environment.
      In this simple implementation,the speed of the bot decreases linearly with 
      temperature. 
      What was the mean temperature that you observed?<br>
      <user>The mean temp was 0.62.</user>
    </li>
    <li>Now modify the orthokinesisNeg controller to make it more effective, such that
      the average temperature of the population is <u>greater than 0.75</u> after 2000 steps.
      Implement a strategy where the speed is 1 when the temperature is below some
      threshold value and is 0 when the temperature is above that value. 
      What threshold value did you use, and what was the average temperature?<br>
      <user>With a threshold of 0.85, I get an average temperature of 0.84.</user>
    </li>
    <li>Now implement the run-tumble controller. The bot speed should always be 1.
      The turn angle should be 0 if the current temperature is greater than the temperature
      on the previous time step. The turn angle should be <code>PI * random(-1, 1)</code>
      otherwise.  You'll need to use <code>this.memory</code> to store information
      about the temperature on the previous time step. 
      When your controller is working properly, the
      average temperature should be <u>greater than 0.75</u> after 2000 steps.
      What was the average temperature that your controller was able to achieve?<br>
      <user>I got an average temperature of 0.76.</user>
    </li>
    <li>A simple positive-klinokinesis controller has been provided for you.
      For positive klinokinesis, the bot turnAngle is larger in warmer areas of the environment. 
      What was the mean temperature that you observed?<br>
      <user>The mean temp was 0.51.</user>
    </li>
    <li>A simple negative-klinokinesis controller has been provided for you.
      For negative klinokinesis, the bot turnAngle is smaller in warmer areas of the environment. 
      What was the mean temperature that you observed?<br>
      <user>The mean temp was 0.47.</user>
    </li>
    <li>Why do you think that the simple klinokinesis controllers above are 
        relatively ineffective at causing the bots to congregate?<br>
      <user>The bots turn randomly, and not necessarily towards the direction they want to go in.</user>
    </li><li>[OPTIONAL] Try to design more effective versions of the two klinokinesis contollers.
      You should leave the bot speed fixed at 1 and only change the turning behavior.
      If needed, you can use the memory variable to store information, but do not
      explicitly store the temperature on the previous time step. If you are successful
      at getting the bots to congregate, describe your controller strategy below.<br>
      <user>Threshold-based kliokinesis controllers did the trick. I had the bugs rotate PI * random(-1, 1) radians, but only if the temperature was above 0.8 for the positive kliokinesis controller or less than 0.2 for the negative one.</user>
    </li><li> About how long did you spend on this assignment? <br>
      <user>About 30 minutes.</user>
    </li>
  </ol>
