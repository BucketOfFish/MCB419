  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    This week’s homework explores the use of spike-based models in visuomotor circuits. 
    You will be implementing two neural circuits for place-code to rate-code conversion from Fig. 3 of the paper by 
    <a href="http://www.life.illinois.edu/mcb/419/pdf/Sarvestani12_lamprey.pdf">Kamali-Sarvestani et al.(2012)</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get started, you should review the <a href="http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/mcb419/sketches/BJaIM36df">Braitenberg spiking demo</a>
    and understand how it works. Then you can move on to the main part of the assignment decribed here. 
    You need to complete the wiring diagram for two cases: prey and predator, as controlled by the ‘predator/prey’ 
    checkbox in the user interface. 
    Specifically, in sketch.js, you need to edit the functions
    <br><code>add_connections_for_prey_approach()</code> and
    <br><code>add_connections_for_predator_escape()</code>.
  </p>

  <h3>Assignment</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Part 1) Implement Circuitry for Prey Approach Mode</b><br> Based on Fig. 3A, complete the wiring diagram and specify appropriate connection weights, such that a wheeled vehicle would display an appropriate orienting response to prey.
    </p><ul>
      <li>
        When the prey is located near the midline (between sensors SL8 and SR8), 
        both wheels should turn at approximately the same speed.
        This would correspond to a straight approach toward the prey.
        <i>The wheel velocities should be roughly between 0.05 and 0.15 rad/sec.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        When the prey is positioned to the far left (in front of sensor SL1), 
        the right wheel should turn much faster than the left wheel, 
        which would correspond to a sharp turn toward the left, toward the prey.
        <i>The right wheel velocity should be roughly between 0.2 and 0.5 rad/sec,
          and the left wheel velocity should be less than 0.05 rad/sec</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        When the prey is positioned to the far right (in front of sensor SR1), 
        the left wheel should turn much faster than the right wheel, 
        which would correspond to a sharp turn toward the right, toward the prey.
        <i>The left wheel velocity should be roughly between 0.2 and 0.5 rad/sec,
          and the right wheel velocity should be less than 0.05 rad/sec</i>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p></p>

  <p>
    <b>Part 2) Implement Circuitry for Predator Escape Mode</b><br> Based on Fig. 3B, complete the wiring diagram and specify appropriate connection weights, such that a wheeled vehicle would display an appropriate orienting response to a predator.
    </p><ul>
      <li>
        When the predator is positioned just to the right of the midline (in front of sensor SR8), 
        the wheels should turn quickly and the right wheel should turn faster than the left wheel, 
        which would correspond to a fast turn to the left, away from the predator.
        <i>The right wheel velocity should be roughly between 0.2 and 0.5 rad/sec,
          and the left wheel velocity should be less than 0.2 rad/sec</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        When the predator is positioned further to the right in front of sensor SR1, 
        the wheels should turn slowly and the right wheel should turn faster than the left wheel, 
        which would correspond to a gradual turn to the left, away from the predator.
        <i>The right wheel velocity should be roughly between 0.1 and 0.2 rad/sec,
          and the left wheel velocity should be less than 0.05 rad/sec</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        Similar relationships hold on the left side.
      </li>
    </ul>
